Original mod by [Loafiat](https://github.com/Loafiat/Newtilla).

# Pootilla
A modified version of Newtilla (Version: Nov 7th) With poop mode enabled (Every lobby is a modded lobby now)

# Installation
First, download [Pootilla](https://github.com/VTMGR/Pootilla/releases) and put that in your plugins. Optionally, you can download the original [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla) aswell, I'd recommend it as most mods won't work without it. Your done, enjoy!
