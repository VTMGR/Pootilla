Original mod by [Loafiat](https://github.com/Loafiat/Newtilla).

# Pootilla
Pootilla is a modified version of Newtilla that works the same way as [Ziptilla](https://github.com/VTMGR/Ziptilla), removing the restriction of only being able to use "legal mods" in modded lobbies. This version is more stable, but some mods might not support it as Newtilla is much newer and less popular.
This is currently made with the version: Nov 7th

# Installation
First, download [Pootilla](https://github.com/VTMGR/Pootilla/releases) and put that in your plugins. Optionally, you can download the original [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla) aswell, I'd recommend it as most mods won't work without it. Your done, enjoy!
